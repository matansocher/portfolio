            <p>Myco is a social community based on cultural creation, ecological and spiritual views.<br />The community is mostly funded from member fees and selling tickets to events organized for community members / the organization itself.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™ve been asked to create two mobile apps:<br />
            1. Ticket purchase app for Events<br />
            2. Producers - Management of events & tickets sales</p>

              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>The HR coordinators were tasked with a labor-intensive process of reviewing manually the monthly attendance cards for most Sanitation employees. They had to meticulously check for instances of overtime and then calculate the compensation for those extra hours worked, based on a complex set of salary agreements. This was a tiring, time consuming & ineffective process, prone to mistakes.</p>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>The project was divided into two components: one focused on ticket purchasing for users and the other on overall event administration.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Redesign of the website (mobile)</li>

              <h2>User Interviews</h2>
              <p>During the design phase, I held interviews with a stakeholder and an experienced producer familiar with the current system and alternatives, for both the Redesign project and the new Producers app.</p>
              <p>Research questions:</p>

            <p>The website already had a ticket purchase option, but it required an upgrade in terms of User Experience as part of the redesign. I conducted benchmarking of competitors such as Funzing and Chillz, which are websites that sell tickets for events.</p>

            <h2>Convert insights into screens</h2>
            <p>With the aim of enhancing the current process, I engaged in user interviews to gain a deeper understanding of their challenges, pain points, and objectives. Through these discussions, I was able to gather valuable insights that informed the creation of user flows specifically tailored to meet the users' needs.</p>
            <h3>Flow charts</h3>
            <p>The purpose of user flows was to visualize the steps a user takes to achieve a goal and identify any friction points or areas for improvement along the way.</p>
